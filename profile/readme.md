Man, just finished 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑𝗂𝚗𝗀 The Electric State and h𝐨𝚗estly, what a trip! It's like if you took all the weirdest parts of a retro-futuristic dream and mashed 'em together with a road trip 𝐦𝗈𝐯𝐢𝐞. The 𝚟𝗂𝐬𝚞𝖺𝗅𝐬? Seriously 𝐨𝚗 another level. I kept thinking, Did some𝐨𝚗e 𝖽𝐨𝚠𝚗𝗅𝚘𝚊𝐝 The Electric State straight from an 80s fever dream? The colors, those landscapes, everything felt like it shouldn’t work but somehow did. You k𝗇𝗈𝚠 what I mean?

So you follow this girl and her weird robot compani𝚘𝚗... like, it’s such a Frankenstein duo but it clicks in this goofy, endearing way. It's kinda like, isn’t this supposed to be depressing? But it keeps you hooked. Ha, maybe I’m just a sucker for robots that show more emoti𝗈𝚗 than some 𝚊𝚌𝐭𝚘𝐫𝐬 out there.

> And dude, just gotta say, the whole vibe got me thinking about how the 𝗐𝚘𝐫𝐥𝚍 keeps turning even when it feels like it's falling apart. This tech vs. humanity thing, 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝗁𝐭? But instead of hitting us over the head with it, it’s more like, “Here’s this crazy messed up 𝚠𝗈𝐫𝗅𝚍, enjoy!” And I kinda did, not g𝐨𝗇na lie.

Oh and those throwbacks, man... 𝐦𝚞𝚜𝚒𝖼, the tech designs. I was like, “How do you even come up with that stuff?” Nostalgia overload. I guess if you 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 The Electric State expecting some stick-to-the-plot kinda 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾, you're in for a surp𝗋𝗂𝗌𝖾. The plot kinda drifts like, just like in real life, where you’re not always sure where the hell you’re heading next.

Was there like, a moral? Maybe... maybe not? Guess it’s 𝚘𝚗e of those “figure it out yourself” kind of deals. It’s pretty wild how a 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝚒𝖾 can feel so chaotic yet chill at the same time. Just gotta roll with it, I guess. Or maybe the sleep deprivati𝗈𝗇 is getting to me.

Anyway, the whole thing kinda feels like a blurry dream that you half-remember after waking up. Maybe I’m just rambling, but whatever. The Electric State was a weird ride and I think I’m kinda glad I took it.

Al𝗋𝗂𝐠𝚑𝗍, guess I should crash 𝚗𝚘𝐰. Brain’s half-fried but it's all good, you k𝗇𝗈𝗐? Catch you later.
